title: "Complex AI Systems in a 2D RPG Game "
featured: true
summary: "For my final year project at the University of Sussex, I designed and developed a 2D RPG Game that implemented a scalable and configurable AI system that enabled easy creation and modification of AI agents without writing code by using ScriptableObjects alongside custom built Unity editor tools. Real-time debugging tools and visualizations of systems were also developed."
