title: "Bullet Hell Engine"
summary: "Using SFML, I developed a 2D bullet hell game engine that could handle tens of thousands of bullets whilst maintaining good performance by merging draw calls. Users can configure attack patterns and bullet behaviours, as well as upload custom art assets through an immediate mode GUI for easier configuration."
